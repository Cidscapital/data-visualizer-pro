## Introduction

Data Visualizer Pro is a web application that allows users to upload CSV files and visualize their data using interactive scatter and line plots. This project was created as part of the curriculum for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.


## Team Members, Roles, and Timeline

This project was completed by a solo developer, with a total development time of approximately three weeks.

## Project Purpose and Target Audience

The purpose of this project was to provide a simple and intuitive tool for individuals and businesses to easily visualize their data without needing to download or install any software. The target audience for this project is anyone who needs to quickly and easily create data visualizations.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local PC.
2. Launch the index.html from your browser or use VS Code's liveserver extension.
3. Upload a CSV file.
4. View generated plots.

## Personal Focus

My personal focus for this project was to solidify my understanding of JavaScript and explore the capabilities of the Plotly library for data visualization.

## Project Result

The completed project fulfilled all of the requirements of the MVP, allowing users to upload CSV files, visualize their data using scatter and line plots, and view the plots on a clean and simple web interface. Additionally, the project included features such as private data processing on the front end and an about page providing additional information about the project.

## Technologies Used

For the front end of this project, I used HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. I opted not to use frameworks to dedicate my time to solidifying my understanding of JavaScript. Additionally, I used the Plotly.js library for data visualization.

## Features

One of the key features of this project is its ability to support CSV files, allowing users to easily upload and visualize their data without needing to convert it to a different format. Additionally, the project includes a clean and simple interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use.

## Most Difficult Technical Challenge

The most difficult technical challenge I encountered during this project was finding a way to dynamically generate the scatter and line plots based on user-uploaded CSV data. Using the Plotly library, I was able to create a static scatter and line plot for demonstration purposes, but creating a dynamic plot that would change based on the user's data proved to be more challenging.

## STAR Method for Technical Challenge

Situation: I needed to find a way to dynamically generate scatter and line plots based on user-uploaded CSV data.

Task: I researched various options and experimented with the Plotly library to find a solution.

Action: I spent several hours reading documentation, watching tutorials, and experimenting with different code snippets to find a way to dynamically generate the plots based on user data.

Result: After several failed attempts, I was finally able to create a dynamic scatter and line plot that would change based on the user's data. The solution involved parsing the CSV data into an array of objects, and using Plotly's update method to update the data and layout of the plot.

## Technical Takeaways

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript and the capabilities of the Plotly.js library for data visualization. I also learned the importance of reading documentation and experimenting with code snippets to find a solution to a challenging problem.

## What I Would Do Differently

If I were to start this project again, I would spend more time researching and experimenting with different approaches before starting to code. This would help me avoid wasting time on dead-end solutions.

## What I Learned About Myself as an Engineer

Through this project, I learned that I enjoy the process of researching and experimenting with code to find a solution to a challenging problem. I also learned that I am capable of working through complex technical challenges and finding solutions that work.
